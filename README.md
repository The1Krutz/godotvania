# Godotvania
It's a little project of mine to loosely recreate Castlevania 3 for NES in Godot. The point isn't a perfectly faithful recreation; it's to learn how to use Godot.

Obviously all the sprites I'm using are copyright of whatever company owns the Castlevania license, so this isn't a publicly available project. This project isn't intended for release.
