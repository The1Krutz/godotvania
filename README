# Godotvania
It's a little project of mine to loosely recreate Castlevania 3 in Godot. The main point isn't a perfectly faithful recreation; it's to learn how to use Godot.

Obviously all the sprites I'm using are copyright of whatever company owns the Castlevania license, so this isn't a publicly available project.
